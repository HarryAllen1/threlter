### [**hack.threltemania.xyz**](https://hack.threltemania.xyz)

Threltemania is a racing game that defies physics.

## Motivation

It is a bit of a tradition to celebrate new versions of [Threlte](https://next.threlte.xyz) with a small game that not only is superb promotional material, but also is used to test every aspect of all moving parts of the Threlte ecosystem.

Threlte 6 is a special release: Threlte is transitioning towards a clear separation of concerns: `@threlte/core` as a way to declaratively use [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and other packages such as `@threlte/extras` with useful abstractions and `@threlte/rapier` to easily integrate the exceptional [Rapier physics engine](https://rapier.rs/).

The next version is called "Threlte v6" and what better way is there to celebrate that than with a V6? I'll see myself out.

## Features

- üëë [**Campaign**](https://hack.threltemania.xyz/menu/campaign): *Official tracks* to race against the clock and win medals.
- üë§ [**User Tracks**](https://hack.threltemania.xyz/menu/user-tracks): Race on tracks built by other players.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Track Editor**: Build and share your own tracks and compete against your friends.

## "Technical" Features

- Options allow for a customized game experience
- Keyboard navigation to navigate the whole game via keyboard
- Game UI implemented in Svelte
- Game mechanics implemented in [Threlte v6](https://next.threlte.xyz)

## Technical Outline

Threltemania holds many different interesting aspects, technically challenging topics and goodies. Here's a rough outline:

- Raycast Vehicle Controller: As opposed to a vehicle controller that is based on many "rigid bodies" that are connected via "joints", this arcade-style vehicle controller is implemented with an approach that lends. The implementation details can be found [here](https://github.com/grischaerbe/threlter/blob/hackathon/src/components/Car/RaycastVehicleController/RaycastVehicleController.svelte).
- Keyboard navigation: As it is with many games, the game Threltemania can be controlled with only the keyboard.
- URL Statemanagement: When a game is started, it typically starts from the very beginning. The web as a platform provides a very powerful statemanagement tool: The URL. SvelteKit's routing is used to determine the current app state. This means that reloading the page will get you where you left off.
- The perfect tool for the job: Svelte components make managing Three.js objects a breeze. Slot props ‚Äì one of my favorite features ‚Äì allow truely magical component compositions. The component lifecycle is used to never the disposal of an object.
- DOM UI and Three.js objects side by side: In game development, the management of UI is always a bit of a pain because they normally cannot be co-located. The web provides the ultimate UI-engine: the DOM. Using Svelte [*portals*](https://github.com/grischaerbe/threlter/blob/hackathon/src/components/Utilities/DomPortal.svelte), the UI can be placed next to actual Three.js objects and allows for ultra-transparent game and UI state references.

This outline does not contain the work that has gone into Threlte v6. If you want to learn more about the upcoming version of Threlte, [visit the Documentation](https://next.threlte.xyz) or [join our Discord community](https://discord.gg/EqUBCfCaGm).
